 2. **Project 2 - ABAP:** **SAP Fiori Elements List Report** - Airlines (SCARR) - SAP ABAP CDS-based Fiori Elements app demonstrating List Report with @UI.identification, table filters, search, and responsive design. Uses standard SCARR demo data (~20 airlines).**
 3. **Project 3 - ABAP:** project contains a custom **ABAP BAdI implementation** for **SAP Business Partner (BP)** that enforces phone number validation during BP maintenance.
 4. **Project 4 - Python & Django:** **VAT-flow app**, which leverages modern Django best practices and robust technologies to deliver a clean, efficient, and feature-rich solution. Its unique blend of automation, data validation, and API integrations sets it apart as a practical and scalable tool.
